To download a copy of the demo [go here](https://drive.google.com/a/affectiva.com/folderview?id=0B968NDUjJFMRY2s5Wk1abEhndWc&usp=sharing).  The emotion buttons all correspond to facial expressions.  For example, if you smile she will smile.  Fog appears when there is no camera or the camera cannot find a face.
